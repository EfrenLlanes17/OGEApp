Project Inflow | Capstone Project for OG+E
Worked with OG+E to develop Project Inflow, an application designed to visualize scanner and panel data from CSV exports at power plants.
 Transformed raw entry/exit scanner data into interactive dashboards featuring graphs, heatmaps, and other visual analytics tools.
 Focused on enhancing safety and enabling preventative maintenance by identifying trends and anomalies in real-time data.
 Built using C# and HTML with the Blazor Framework.
